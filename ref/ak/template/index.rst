Templates
=========

The Akshell template engine (the template_ module) provides a powerful
mini-language for defining the user-facing layer of your application,
encouraging a clean separation of application and presentation
logic. Templates can be maintained by anyone with an understanding of
HTML; no knowledge of JavaScript is required.

The engine is a JavaScript port of the `Django template engine`__. A
major part of this text is borrowed from the Django documentation.
