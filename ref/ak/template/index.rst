Templates
=========

The Akshell template engine (the `template.js`_ file) provides a
powerful mini-language for defining the user-facing layer of your
application, encouraging a clean separation of application and
presentation logic. Templates can be maintained by anyone with an
understanding of HTML; no knowledge of JavaScript is required.

The engine is a JavaScript port of the `Django template engine`__. A
major part of this text is borrowed from the Django documentation.
